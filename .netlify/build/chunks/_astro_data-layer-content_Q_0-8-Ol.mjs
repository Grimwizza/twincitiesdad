Fair question.\n\nHere's the honest answer: **I couldn't stay silent anymore.**\n\nI'm a father living in the Twin Cities. I've got kids in school, a mortgage to pay, and a community I care about. And like many of you, I've watched the political landscape shift dramatically over the past few years. Things feel different now—more intense, more polarized, more consequential.\n\nI started this blog because I needed a place to process it all. To share what I'm seeing, what I'm reading, and what I'm thinking. Not as a political commentator or a professional journalist, but as a dad who's trying to figure out what all of this means for my family and my community.\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThis isn't going to be a rant blog or a doom-scroll destination. That's not helpful to anyone. Instead, I'm aiming for something more constructive:\n\n- **News with context** — I'll share important stories happening in Minnesota and help break down what they actually mean\n- **Data and facts** — When I make claims, I'll back them up with evidence. We've got enough opinions floating around\n- **Local perspective** — What's happening in our schools, our neighborhoods, our state\n- **Real talk from a real person** — I'm not pretending to have all the answers\n\n## A Community Conversation\n\nI don't want this to be a monologue. The comments section is open, and I genuinely want to hear from you. Agree with me, disagree with me, share your own experiences—that's what makes this worthwhile.\n\nMinnesota has always been a place where people came together despite their differences. That's harder now, but it's not impossible. Maybe this small corner of the internet can be part of that.\n\n## Let's Go\n\nSo here we are. First post. New blog. Uncertain times.\n\nBut I believe in Minnesota. I believe in community. And I believe that fathers—parents of all kinds—have important perspectives to share.\n\nThanks for being here. Let's figure this out together.\n\n—*Twin Cities Dad*\n\n---\n\n*Follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twincitiesdad), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/twincitiesdad), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/twincitiesdad).
